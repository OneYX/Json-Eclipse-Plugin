Road map

Fix JSON Validation
 - trailing comma is not detected
 - not multi file stops after first object


"The validation just does not work consistently and frankly that is the most valuable part.
It manages to flag some errors sometimes (missing commas for example) but it isn't consistent
and it doesn't catch some really glaring problems like the closing bracket being missing
from a list or the last curly brace missing from the JSON body."

Fix - [WARNING] No explicit target runtime environment configuration. Build is platform dependent
